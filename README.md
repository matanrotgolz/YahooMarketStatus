# About the App 
This app is a stock chart that is built with React and uses Yahoo stock API in order to get the data.
The app comes with  log-in and sign up pages. In order to see the stock data, the user will have to be registered.
The user can then filter and sort the results to see exactly what he wants.

## `How the project works?`
  First the client will have to log in or sign up to the system (right now this option has default value's as the system is not connected to any DB)
  and that's it ! After the log-in screen the App starts to fetch data from Yahoo's API, and then you can select  rows  to repesent them only , and also sort and
  control the results.
