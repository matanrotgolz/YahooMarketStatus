# About the App 
This app is a stock chart that is built with React and use Yahoo stock API in order to get the data.
The app comes with a log-in and sign up pages. In order to see the stock data, the user will have to be registered to see the stock data.
The user can filter and sort the results to see exactly what he want's.


## `How the project works?`
  First the client will have to log in or sign up to the system (right now this option have default value's as the system is not connected to any DB).
  And that's it ! after the log-in screen the App start to fetch data from Yahoo API, you can select row and to repesent them only , you can sort and
  basiclly control the results.
